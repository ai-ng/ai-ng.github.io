Hi, 

This blog is all about Aritificial Intelligence (AI) and its applicability to solving problems in Nigeria. The AI renaissance (which is currently all about supervised machine learning) is underway and we want to ensure that Nigeria is not left out. It is currently managed by two AI enthusiasts (See [below](#about-us)).

We will be blogging about current AI techniques that works as well as research into techniques that will power future AI systems. We understand that the current knowledge that has been produced by the recent surge of AI research can be applied to some pretty interesting problems today (e.g. language translation systems, better photo filters, some aspect of self driving, generating codes from UI design and so on). Hence we want to enable the use of such techniques to produce AI technologies for the Nigerian environment.

We plan to write blog posts to help enlighten others (mostly Nigerians) to get them interested in AI and to enable them use it to tackle interesting (and not so interesting problems). Additionally, in the course of time, we will also be working on some interesting AI projects tailored to local Nigerian environment and write blog post about it

Topics we will cover includes (but not limited to) general AI introducation, deep learning, deep learning frameworks, AI/deep-learning research, techniques and focused application areas with respect to Nigeria.
Each blog post can either be classifed as **technical (research related or theoritical underpinnings)** or **application (application areas)** or **project**.

Any AI enthusiasts, experts, researchers in Nigeria and all over the world are welcome to write guest blog post on this blog.

You can get in touch with us [here](mailto:wecodeanything@outlook.com) and [here](mailto:mikaelovi@gmail.com). We'd love to hear from you.

  
  
## About Us
### Ese
My name is Ese Ben, a programmer with strong interest in Artificial Intelligence. The human brain fascinates me, hence my interest in Artificial Intelligence. I also believe the field of neuroscience is nice and impactful. I have done some work in AI while studying at at undergraduate and graduate (MSC) levels, applying genetic algorithm to network security and neural network to machine vision. I am by no means an expert yet, but I am willing to share my understanding of AI.

I have this conceptual view that a better understanding of the human brain will lead to advancement in AI (especially neural network) and reversing the equation, advancement in AI will lead to better understanding of the brain. The future of technology has AI written over it. People are going to interact with AI directly or indirectly as we already see in this early days. 

### Ovie
My name is Michael Ovie (mikaelovi) and I am passionate about technology. My fascination about artificial intelligence dates back to my very first introduction to the field in my final year undergraduate days and ever since then, I have explored the field both in graduate and undergraduate levels. I love the rigor associated with research in this area and I am prepared for the exploits that follow. My immediate interest is to see how Nigeria becomes very much better by the intervention of AI technologies in providing personalized solutions to our needs as a people in the areas of security, transportation, business, lifestyle, to mention a few. I pledge to undertake this for the love of my country and so help me God.
