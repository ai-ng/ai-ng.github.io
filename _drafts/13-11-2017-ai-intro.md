… We’re back again! In this post, we are going to focus on providing an overview of the concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Moving forward…
What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
In our view, Demis Hassabis gives a well suitable definition to AI. He defines AI as the science (scientific study) of making “machines” smart. Take note that the term “machines” was used, not just computer systems. This means that on the long run, our machines will have some level of intelligence integrated into them. In the past, AI was a small sub-field in Computer Science; however, it has since grown into a large and dynamic field that now houses new sub-fields (see next paragraph). Additionally, it is worth noting that AI as a field draws inspiration from other scientific fields such as Cognitive Science, Neuro Science, Psychology, Mathematics and so on.
AI research is made of different sub-fields. They include; (Machine) Learning, Reasoning, Logic, Brute-force and Heuristic searching etc. Techniques and methods that powers research in these AI sub-fields are usually mathematical in nature, involving some forms of optimization problem. In fact, the techniques are the lowest level of AI hierarchy (see diagram below). Examples of AI techniques include Constraint Satisfaction, Tree searching, Rule-based models, Support Vector Machines and so on. There are also biological inspired techniques, which are more popular. These are; Artificial Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming, Fuzzy Logic, Swarm Intelligence, Ant Colony optimization and so on.
Additionally, there are sub-fields of AI research applications (which involves applying AI techniques in Learning, Logic, Reasoning, etc.). Sub fields of AI research applications include Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Understanding, Control (ability to act in an environment), Pattern Recognition, etc.
Sub-fields of AI research application can viewed as raw materials used to build real-world practical intelligent systems such as self-driving cars. Think of how this translates to humans: as babies, we learn to build (basic) mental models of the world based on abstract human concepts (such as recognizing objects, speaking and understanding text as well as images, etc.) and then when we grow up, we can then learn how to drive. Therefore, a pre-requisite for a human to learn driving is to understand visual images/scenes, ability speak (if need be) and so on.
Among the various AI research sub-fields, (Machine) Learning currently receives the most attention. This is because of the state of the art results that it has produced over the last two decades. Learning involves building intelligent machines by giving them the ability to learn tasks from examples (data). It is a very good approach to AI rather than encoding rules about (world) knowledge using Logic based approach. In fact, humans and animals act intelligently because of interactions and learning about how the world works via our brains. In fact, most of the current AI research applications use advances in Machine Learning research. This leads us to further discussion about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Deep learning will be covered in a future blog post.
Machine Learning is a sub-field of AI that entails the process of designing and building intelligent machines that learn task(s) from examples (data) thus building experience. Common AI techniques/methods used in Machine Learning includes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression etc. In fact, Artificial Neural Network (which we will cover in a future blog post) is the most common type of techniques used in Machine Learning. This owes to the fact that it can be used to build multiple levels of abstraction from the examples used to train the system.
That’s it for now. The next blog post will focus on just Machine Learning, reviewing the different types of learning.

Note:
When we speak of intelligent machines, it’s mostly in the form of just softwares for now. The field that merges both intelligent software and hardware (in other form factors than our regular computer) is called Robotics.
Additionally, it is worth noting that a machine’s intelligence is still very very (pardon the repetition) primitive and narrow. A full-blown human-like intelligence does not yet exist in machines. This is mostly called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and we are not close to achieving such feat. However, some AI scientist are working on this problem. This brings up a whole lot of debate about such AGI threats to human existence; however, we are not going to focus on that in this blog. This blog is mostly about the recent Machine Learning techniques, advances and how it can be applied to solve societal issues.
