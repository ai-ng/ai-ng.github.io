… and we’re back.
In this post we are going to focus on providing overview of what AI is all about.

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
I like the way [Demis Hassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis) defines AI. He defines AI as the science (scientific study) of making “machines” smart. Take note that the term “machines” was used, not just computer systems. This means that on the long run, our machines will have some level of intelligence integrated into it. In the past, AI was a small sub-field in Computer Science, however it has since grown into a large and dynamic field that now houses new sub-fields (see next paragraph). Additionally, it is worth noting that AI as a field draws inspiration from other scientific fields such as Cognitive Science, Neuro Science, Psychology, Mathematics and so on.

**AI research** is divided into different sub-fields. They include; *(Machine) Learning, Reasoning, Logic, Bruteforce and Heuristic searching etc*. **Techniques and methods** that powers research in these AI sub-fields are usually mathematical in nature, involving some forms of optimisation problem. Infact the techniques are the lowest level of AI hierach (see diagram below). Examples of AI techniques include Constraint Satisfaction, Tree searching, Rule-based models, Support Vector Machines and so on. There are also biological inspired techniques which are more popular. These are; Artifical Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming, Fuzzy Logic, Swarm Intelligence, Ant Colony optimisation and so on.

Additionally, there are sub-fields of **AI research application** (which basically means applying techniques in Learning, Logic, Reasoning, etc). They include: Sub fields of AI research applications includes: *Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Understanding, Control (ability to act in an environment), Pattern Recoginition etc*.

Sub-fields of **AI research application can viewed as raw materials** used to build real-world **practical intelligent systems** such as self-driving cars. Think of how this translates to humans: as babies, we learn to build (basic) mental models of the world based on abstract human concept (such as recoginising objects, speaking understanding text and images etc) and then when we grow up, we can then learn how to drive. Therefore, a pre-requisite for a human to learn driving is to understand visual images/scenes, ability speak (if need be) and so on.

Among the various AI research sub-fields, **(Machine) Learning** receives the most attention currently. This is because of the excellent results that it has produced over the last two decades. Learning involves buidling intelligent machines by giving it the ability to learn a task from examples (data). It is a very good approach to AI rather than encoding rules about (world) knowledge using Logic based approach. In fact humans and animals act intelligently as a result of learning about how the world works via our brains. In fact, most of the current AI research applications use advances in Machine Learning research. This leads us to further discuss about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Deep learning will be covered in a future blog post.

Machine Learning is a sub-field of AI that entails the process of designing and building intelligent machines that learns task(s) from examples (data) thus building experience. Common AI technqiues/methods used in Machine Learning includes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression etc. In fact Artificial Neural Network (which we will cover in a future blog post) is the most common type of technique used in Machine Learning. This owes to the fact that it can be used to build multiple levels of abstraction from the examples used to train the system.

That’s it for now. The next blog post will focus on just Machine Learning, reviewing the different types of learning.

### Note:
when we speak of intelligent machines, it’s mostly in the form of just softwares for now. The field that merges both intelligent software and hardware (in other form factors than our regular computer) is called **Robotics.**

Additionally, it is worth noting that a machine’s intelligence is still very very primitive and narrow. A full blown human like intelligence does not yet exist in machines. This is mostly called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and we are not close to achieving such feat. However, some AI scientist are working on this problem. This brings up a whole lot of debate about such AGI threats to human existence, however, we are not going to focus on that in this blog. This blog is mostly about the recent Machine Learning techniques, advances and how it can be applied to solve societal issues.
