title: What can AI do for us in Nigeria?
category: intro
---

> TL; DR
> In this post, we focus on establishing the need for AI in Nigeria (which can also apply to other countries) through the perspective of problems well suited for AI to solve. We would love to hear from you about other sectors/areas AI can be applied in Nigeria (drop a comment below or shoot us an [email](mailto:wecodeanything@outlook.com))

## Introduction
Before diving into discussions/posts about AI techniques and applications (in future posts), it is important that we ponder on what problems AI technology can solve in Nigeria. This is true for any (new) technology being applied in any society. Therefore, the focus of this post is to establish the need for AI in Nigerian environment/societies. 

## Not Every Nigerian Problem needs AI
To start us off, let us take a quick look at some of our Nation’s challenges that AI cannot solve. It cannot out rightly solve our electric power challenge, or bad roads. AI is not some magic potion that can mystically make all these challenges go away. These are challenges that do not need AI to solve them even though it could play a part in their respective solutions. Now let us move on to what AI can do for us.

## 1. Transportation / Traffic Flow
While the idea of self-driving cars is a pleasing one, it is not immediately applicable to the Nigerian context and as far as transportation is concerned, one of our greatest concerns is traffic. Commuters as well as drivers (commercial and private) would appreciate any solution in this regard that addresses traffic. In fact, there’s a radio station in Lagos state that is dedicated to helping people navigate through the roads of Lagos especially during traffic-prone hours and this is much accepted and appreciated. We believe that building a real-time traffic prediction system that would work just as a weather prediction system would be appropriate in solving this challenge so that before the hour, using transportation data, traffic situations can be predicted/projected and validated. Depending on its efficiency and reliability, this system could become an integral part of our transportation system solving one of its greatest challenge, **_traffic_**.

Although, the idea of self-driving cars may still be far-fetched for now (in the Nigerian context), it may be sensible to start with a smaller scope. [This suggestion of Self Driving Keke Maruwa (tricycles)](https://youtu.be/XjsYNnMmetM?t=385) might be one interesting direction to explore. If we can get this right, then we can start looking into self driving automobiles.

## 2. Health Care
This is an interesting area because we have an opportunity to leverage AI tech to become a global player in health care. The major reason for this is that our current infrastructure for health care is quite basic. This is important because it means we can build our health care system from ground up as an AI first sytem. Current (legacy) health care systems in the developed countries were built without consideration of AI. This means that they will have to do a lot of work (e.g. re-draft policies, modify systems, re-consider data privacy etc) in order for them to meaningfully apply AI to health care.

Apparently, we share the same passion with digitalhealth Nigeria in the medical domain as seen in this [post](http://digitalhealth.com.ng/2016/10/29/tech-doctor-shortage-nigeria/). The crust of our interest is to employ the use of AI in diagnosing common and critical health problems such as cancer, sight problems, and so on. This system would help address the issue of shortage of doctors, incorrect diagnosis due to human or (faulty) equipment errors and delay in diagnosis. The most interesting fact is that this system would improve with time until it becomes unimaginably vast based on its learning over time.

## 3. Local/Ethnic Language (Natural Language Human-Computer Interaction)
We make an argument for better Human-Computer interaction system with respect to speech recognition system. Many people say that mobile peneration in Africa is a big deal, however, it’s going to be even bigger when people can interact with their smart phone/devices more naturally through speech. This is currently possible, howbeit in a very crude form. We believe a major set back with the usage/adoption of current speech systems by the Nigeria populace is that: **they mostly provide only English Language as an interface for interaction**. Even though English is our primary language, there are several other (local/ethnic) languages which we use in our daily lives (e.g. Pidgin English, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa and other local dialect). *A bit subjective here, but we argue that many Nigerians are more comfortable experessing themselves in these other languages than English itself. If you are in doubt, observe local market places in Nigeria.*

Another factor to that is equally important is that even when we stick to just English, different regions in Nigeria have different English accents. This is another factor not to be ignored. With recent AI advances, we can actually work on building our very own speech system that understands local dialect. We can start small. For starters, we can gather a pidgin English dataset, train and build speech system that understand pidgin English and then we can then replicate to other dialects.

## 4. Banking
*Can we imagine a user of banking services in Nigeria having access to a personalized banking experience any day and at any time, without any kind of error or misinformation? Cool right?*

The adoption of chatbot in the banking industry is something that is worth exploring in Nigeria for obvious reasons. Enhanced Customer Personalization is a profound benefit of adopting AI in banking. According to the [2017 retail banking trends and prediction report](https://thefinancialbrand.com/62858/2017-top-banking-trends-predictions-forecast-digital-fintech-data-api/), improvement in personalized banking experience in banking for customers takes the top spot. It calls for a renewed focus on the customer experience. Although, there are many more opportunities for applying AI in the Nigerian banking domain, we want to focus on the aforementioned and hope to progress into addressing other pressing issues that will help banks render their services to customers better and help the customers enjoy better banking experiences.

## 5. Education
The concept of "personalised education" has been floating around for a while now. Just like the idea of a Digital Personal Assistant, why not have "Personal Teacher" for each student offered through an AI based system. Imagine a scenario where each student have their own unique teacher that undertands them and monitors their educational progress in order to create personalised learning plan for the student. This [article](https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/25/11492102/bill-gates-interview-education-software-artificial-intelligence) is a good description of this idea. 
Current MOOCs such as [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and so on, are good examples of a very crude form of personalised learning. There is need for us to build "Personalised Teacher" systems for primary and secondary schools. I believe an important feature of such system is it’s ability to work offline reliably (considering cost of internet purchase here and other internet issues).

## 6. Agriculture
[AI application areas and how best to apply it in agriculture (that will make the most impact) are not yet super clear](https://agfundernews.com/the-challenges-for-artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture.html), but if applied correctly, it is going to make a huge impact considering that agriculture produces a substantial portion of the country's GDP.
In Nigeria, small scale farming is still dominant ([more than 80% small scale farmers](http://www.eajournals.org/wp-content/uploads/A-Review-of-Smallholder-Farming-In-Nigeria.pdf)) and hence we need to seek application areas that will be useful for small scale farming (not all AI solutions for large scale farming translates to small scale and vice versa).

According to this [talk](https://youtu.be/OmugiPdc9QY?list=PLOb_h4hKJ00qt9eoBLr3MtsIdCdRaUzmR&t=273), one of the challenges of agriculture in the country is **wastage**. About 40% of produced is lost to wastage (as a result of; lack of proper transportation, lack of storage facilities, lack of proper communication channels). We believe most of the challenges from wastage can be solved without the use of AI. For example, proper transportation can be solved by constructing better roads and logistics channels.

However, another cause of wastage comes from diseases attacking crops/animal before (during growth stage) and after harvest period. AI can be used to tackle this challenge, by building systems that monitor crops and animals and then predict disease outbreak before they even occur. For most part, such systems built by technologist are mostly vision related (i.e. may include the use of drones - for movement across farm and camera(s) mounted on drones to capture images that will be feed into the AI model for prediction.

Another AI use case to improve effiency involves developing an easy to use vision system to automate crop classification during harvest. For more application areas we found searching the web are listed below for your reading pleasure (some of these suggestion may not apply to the Nigerian context of agriculture as explained earlier): links [here](http://ai.business/2016/05/06/artificial-intelligence-in-agriculture-part-2-how-farming-is-going-automated-with-ai-technologies/), [here](https://www.yenlo.com/blog/5-applications-of-artificial-intelligence-that-are-used-and-useful), and [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-applications-of-AI-in-the-field-of-agriculture).


## In conclusion...
There may be other areas/sectors AI can be applied in Nigeria that we have not covered. We would love to hear from you about these sectors (drop a comment below or shoot us an [email](mailto:mikaelovi@gmail.com))

The promise of practical application of AI has been earnestly anticipated for a very long time predating back to the 90s. It is not until recently we are now experiencing a rapid adoption of the technology, especially with Deep Learning techniques.

It is therefore important that we start considering how this technology can be of benefit to us here in Nigeria. The truth is, nations around the world are trying to wrap their heads around AI and how it’s going to define the coming future, hence, so much actions are already set in motion in various capacities such as policies formation, to mention a few.

The aim of the post is not to compare Nigeria with other Nations interested in AI. Rather it’s a thought provoker with a simple statement that: **If we don’t start building AI systems to tackle our own challenges, then whether we like it or not, we are going to be heavy purchasers (consumers) of AI technology just like it happened with smartphones**. In fact, we have already started consuming AI products howbeit in it’s primitive form through Apple’s Siri, Google Photos, facebook's auto-tagging for photos, Machine Learning APIs (for mobile/web apps developers) etc.
