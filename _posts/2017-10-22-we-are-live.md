... and we're live ...
We will be blogging about Artiificial Intelligence (AI) from different facets and its applicability to some interesting (or not so interesting) problems in Nigeria.  

We will write about AI techniques with special focus on Machine Learning/Deep Learning which is the hottest area of AI technology at the moment. We understand that in years to come there will be advances in other non deep learning areas in AI. Therefore, we will also write about these areas as well.  

This blog is currently managed by two Nigerian AI enthusiast ([Ese](https://github.com/dlpbc) and Ovie)  
Stay tuned...
